# Object Recognition using MobileNet-SSD (OpenCV)

This project implements a **real-time object recognition system** using a pre-trained **MobileNet-SSD** deep learning model with **OpenCV’s DNN module**.  
The system captures live video from a webcam, detects common objects, and draws bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores.
